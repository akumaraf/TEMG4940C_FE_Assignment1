This To-Do list is inspired by a Kanban board design on google. The code has three components: HTML, CSS, and Javascript file.
To execute the code, download the HTML, CSS and Javascript files in the same folder. Double click on the HTML file to open the app. 

Within the app, you will be able to drag, drop, reorder, create, edit, and delete cards representing a task. These cards will persist
even after the page is refreshed or the app is closed and reopened using the standard way described (double clicking the HTML).
